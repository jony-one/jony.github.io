/**
 * 给定一个整数数组 A，以及一个整数 target 作为目标值，
 * 返回满足 i < j < k 且 A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target 
 * 的元组 i, j, k 的数量。
 * <p>
 * 由于结果会非常大，请返回 结果除以 10^9 + 7 的余数。
 * <p>
 *  
 * <p>
 * 示例 1：
 * <p>
 * 输入：A = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
 * 输出：20
 * 解释：
 * 按值枚举（A[i]，A[j]，A[k]）：
 * (1, 2, 5) 出现 8 次；
 * (1, 3, 4) 出现 8 次；
 * (2, 2, 4) 出现 2 次；
 * (2, 3, 3) 出现 2 次。
 * 示例 2：
 * <p>
 * 输入：A = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
 * 输出：12
 * 解释：
 * A[i] = 1，A[j] = A[k] = 2 出现 12 次：
 * 我们从 [1,1] 中选择一个 1，有 2 种情况，
 * 从 [2,2,2,2] 中选出两个 2，有 6 种情况。
 *  
 * <p>
 * 提示：
 * <p>
 * 3 <= A.length <= 3000
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 100
 * 0 <= target <= 300
